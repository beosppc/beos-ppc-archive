# PowerDown
This is a simple utility for PowerMacs that enables use of the power button 
on a Mac ADB keyboard to shut down the computer. At the moment it only checks
for the power button under BeOS PowerPC, but it could be extended to use
other key combinations on non-Mac hardware.

This software is freeware. I (Matt Emson) wrote it back in the 2000's. It was
originally available on BeBits. I think this version was the last released
source code, but I'm not 100% sure. I certainly don't have anything later.

Please use, but no waranty etc is given. Use at your own risk.
