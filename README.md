# The BeOS PowerPC preservation project archive
This repository attempts to collect together every free/opensource BeOS PowerPC app/library, for the 
first time, in one place to make it easier for those who still use BeOS PowerPC to find and get access 
to those apps.

We focus on BeOS PowerPC because it is the unloved and forgotted platform, but the genesis of BeOS on 
Intel and also the inspiration for Haiku.

This archive will contain every package we can find. Most will initially be in a compressed form, but as
we take each package and test under BeOS, we will put the source code we find outside of any archive and 
will try to package up the source and binaries are assets to make finding the zips easier. The main site
associated with this account will become a page that documents our activities and has direct links to 
the software - a bit like a static BeBits I guess.

Any significant project will be put in to its own repository.

We also hope to port more moders software to BeOS PowerPC and have started to gather tools to make this
possible. We are currently collabourating with the Retro68 project to get a modern C compiler.

# Organisation
This repo is a dumping ground. All new apps will and up here in vague categories. As we process the 
archives we will move the sourcecode and binaries around. Pleade do not rely on this repo as a source. 
The main site and the assets against the various projects will feed the data, we intend this repo to 
house legacy source code that we are not planning to update.
