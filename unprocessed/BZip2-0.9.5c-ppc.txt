                 File:  BZip2-0.9.5c-ppc.pkg
           Author:  Michael Griebling (mgriebling@inspired.to)
         Release:  V0.9.5c for BeOS, 2 September 1999
Compatibility:  R4.5
        Location:  contrib/util
    Description:  Gzip-like utility with much better compression.
             Notes:  Now includes precompiled binaries.
Bzip2  compresses  files  using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting 
text compression algorithm,  and  Huffman  coding.
Compression  is  generally  considerably  better than that
achieved by more conventional LZ77/LZ78-based compressors,
and  approaches  the performance of the PPM family of statistical 
compressors.  It is around twice as fast at compression and six
times faster at decompression than other compressors and it
is patent-free.  This archive includes a pre-compiled version for
BeOS.

The command-line options are deliberately very similar  to
those of GNU Gzip, but they are not identical.

NEW IN 0.9.5.c (vs 0.9.0c)

Major change: add a fallback sorting algorithm (blocksort.c)
to give reasonable behaviour even for very repetitive inputs.
Nuked --repetitive-best and --repetitive-fast since they are
no longer useful.

Open stdin/stdout in binary mode for DJGPP.

Change BZ_N_OVERSHOOT to be ... + 2 instead of ... + 1.  The + 1
version could cause the sorted order to be wrong in some extremely
obscure cases.  Also changed setting of quadrant in blocksort.c.

Minor changes: mostly a whole bunch of small changes/
bugfixes in the driver (bzip2.c).  Changes pertaining to the
user interface are:

   allow decompression of symlink'd files to stdout
   decompress/test files even without .bz2 extension
   give more accurate error messages for I/O errors
   when compressing/decompressing to stdout, don't catch control-C
   read flags from BZIP2 and BZIP environment variables
   decline to break hard links to a file unless forced with -f
   allow -c flag even with no filenames
   preserve file ownerships as far as possible
   make -s -1 give the expected block size (100k)
   add a flag -q --quiet to suppress nonessential warnings
   stop decoding flags after --, so files beginning in - can be handled
   resolved inconsistent naming: bzcat or bz2cat ?
   bzip2 --help now returns 0

NEW IN 0.9.0.c (vs 0.9.0b)

Fixed some problems in the library pertaining to some boundary cases.
This makes the library behave more correctly in those situations.  The
fixes apply only to features (calls and parameters) not used by
bzip2.c, so the non-fixedness of them in previous versions has no
effect on reliability of bzip2.c.


WHAT'S NEW IN 0.9.0 (as compared to 0.1pl2) ?

   * Approx 10% faster compression, 30% faster decompression
   * -t (test mode) is a lot quicker
   * Can decompress concatenated compressed files
   * Programming interface, so programs can directly read/write .bz2 files
   * Less restrictive (BSD-style) licensing
   * Flag handling more compatible with GNU gzip
   * Much more documentation, i.e., a proper user manual
   * Hopefully, improved portability (at least of the library)
 
I only ported this package to the BeOS so please direct
