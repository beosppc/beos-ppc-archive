Release:        	1
Version:        	1.3
Compatibility:  	R4
Location:       	/contrib/network
Notes:

diner is the first third party HTTP-server for the BeOS. It was written from
the ground up and is a 100% native implementation, designed to support
and use the BeOS' special features and capabilites.

In addition to standard features, such as support for virtual servers and
multiple ports, it uses the BeOS AddOn interface to enable easy integration
of custom built server extensions.

The enhanced Inline Module Invocation system makes it trivial to host
dynamic web pages with some simple lines of HTML.

diner is part of the InternetSuite - the server package including HTTP, FTP
and e-Mail servers. This version is without keyfile which puts some
restrictions on diner. You are allowed to test diner for a period of 30 days.
