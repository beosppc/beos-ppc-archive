Notes:

enamel is a server and client package for emails and news. enamel is split 
into several programs to import, process, export and for sure, to read email
and news. The current news support is very beta and might lead to problems,
but give it a try!

enamel is part of the InternetSuite concepted by Stegemann & Co., Inc., which
is commercial software. This version ships without keyfile which puts some
restrictions on enamel. You are allowed to test enamel for a period of 30 days.
